# Sheet Command

The Sheet Command manipulates information on Google Sheets using a sheets link provided. This includes adding, updating, deleting and listing Pokemon Showdown replay data. Particularly useful for mass tracking of data across different battles in Draft League environments. Keep in mind you would need to have edit permissions on the sheet to be able to use the commands, and would need to undergo an authorization process with an email that has edit permissions (no need for authorization if previous command in the same server was used by the same account) to do so. Make sure that players continuously use the same Pokemon Showdown username for updating information accurately.

## Clodbot, sheet set (Google Sheets Link)

Takes in a Google Sheets link and sets it as the default link for any subsequent sheet commands that use a Google Sheets link besides this one (limited to server) so that the Google Sheets link argument could be skipped. Sends a message with the set sheet name and link after.

## Clodbot, sheet update (Optional Google Sheets Link) (Pokemon Showdown Replay Link)

Takes in a Google Sheets link (optional if default set) and a Pokemon Showdown replay link and first checks to see if a sheet exists called "Stats" on the Google Sheets link. If not, it creates it. It then updates that sheet with information about both players and the Pokemon used with their games played, kills and deaths. If the player section with their Pokemon Showdown username exists, it updates their section with any new Pokemon and their stats, alongside with adding stats to existing Pokemon from the replay. If the player section does not exist, it creates a new one with the associated information.
