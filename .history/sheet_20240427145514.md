# Sheet Command

The Sheet Command manipulates information on Google Sheets using a sheets link provided. This includes adding, updating, deleting and listing Pokemon Showdown replay data. Particularly useful for mass tracking of data across different battles in Draft League environments. Keep in mind you would need to have edit permissions on the sheet to be able to use the commands, and would need to undergo an authorization process with an email that has edit permissions (no need for authorization if previous command in the same server was used by the same account) to do so.

## Clodbot, sheet set (Google Sheets Link)

Takes in a Google Sheets link and sets it as the default link for any subsequent sheet commands that use a Google Sheets link besides this one (limited to server) so that the Google Sheets link argument could be skipped. Sends a message with the set sheet name and link after.
